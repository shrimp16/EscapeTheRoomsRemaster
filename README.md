# EscapeTheRoomsRemaster

In this game you will explore multiple rooms in order to find passwords.

To find those passwords you'll have to find clues and solve puzzles.

# Origin

The first idea for this game started during an end of season special @ <Academia de CÃ³digo_> where we had to code a game that would be played using the terminal.

I'm recreating the game but now utilizing different technologies.
